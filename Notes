It's a quantum algorithm designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. 
            -Combinatorial optimization problems are problems where you need to find the best solution from a finite but large set of possible solutions.

A variational approach with classical optimization techniques means that QAOA uses both quantum and classical methods to find an optimal solution. Here‚Äôs how it works:

        Variational Approach (Quantum Part)

            -QAOA prepares a quantum state based on adjustable parameters ùõΩ and Œ≥. These parameters define how the quantum system evolves.The quantum circuit is run multiple times to estimate the expectation value (a measure of how good a solution is).

        Classical Optimization

            -The expectation value is fed into a classical optimizer (like gradient descent, Nelder-Mead, or COBYLA).The classical optimizer updates Œ≤ and Œ≥ to improve the solution.This process repeats until we find the best parameters that give the optimal solution.

Why is this useful?
    Since quantum computers can explore many states in parallel, they help find good solutions faster than classical-only methods. But since they are noisy, classical optimization is used to fine-tune results.

Key components:
    -Cost Hamiltonian (H_C): Encodes the optimization problem.
    -Mixer Hamiltonian (H_M): Introduces transitions between states.
    -Parameterized Quantum Circuit: Uses angles Œ≤ and Œ≥ to optimize the solution.
